RH demo examples

This directory contains three demo applications generated by the RH (Reactive HTML) builder:

- Temperature Converter
- Physics Calculator
- Currency Converter

How to generate these examples:

Run the demo script and specify this directory as the output:

```bash
python3 i/rh/misc/wip/demo.py --outdir i/rh/examples
```

Then open any of the `index.html` files in a browser to interact with the demos.

Notes:
- Each demo includes a Submit button which triggers a client-side JSON download of the current form data.
- If you run the app via the development server (builder.serve()), the app will attempt to POST to `window.__rh_save_endpoint__` if set; otherwise the client-side download is always available.
